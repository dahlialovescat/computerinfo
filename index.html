<h1>Computer Building: Where to Start</h1>
<p> Building yor own PC can give you a lot of options. Compared to buying a prebuilt, building your own computer might not
    take as much effort as you think. Building your own computer and choosing parts allows for a highly customizable
    piece of machinery tailored just to your needs. Buying a prebuilt might be easier overall, but the benefit of building
    your own PC is miles ahead. </p>
<h2>What You'll Need</h2>
<h3>The Case</h3>
<p> Choosing a case for your computer depends on what you're looking for. The case can set the tone for the built, a bigger
case allowing for more storage. A smaller case might be needed if you don't have the space or depending on what you're looking for .
    The only concern is that you need to match your motherboard's form factor with your case's specifications.</p>
<h3>The Motherboard</h3>
<p>Shopping for a motherboard can have many nuiances, but you generally need to research three things.
You want to make sure the motherboard you choose works with the CPU you choose. The motherboard also
needs to be the right size and shape for your case. You also need to make sure the motherboard has both
external and interal ports for what you want to install.</p>
