<h2>
    Building your PC: Steps
</h2>
<h6>
   There are many ways to build a PC (Personal Computer). These are the
    steps in order that made the most sense to me, but my list is not the law.
    If you want to build your PC in a different order, go ahead! But, if you want
    a general idea of the steps to actually building a PC, my list can help.
</h6>
<h2>
    Gather materials
</h2>
<h6>First, you must have a clean space to start the build. You want to make sure
you have every component you'll need along with enough space to start. </h6>
<h2>
    Install CPU into motherboard
</h2>
<h6>First, you're going to want to find the CPU socket on the motherboard. Press down on the lever and swing it out
    to open the latch. Line up the CPU's triangle or dot with the same marking on the motherboard. Gently place the CPU
    into the socket so it rests on the pins. Lower the latch and close the lever to secure the CPU. Make sure the CPU
    is fully seated in the socket and centered. If it's not, gently lift it up and re-seat it.</h6>
<h2>
    Adding RAM into the Motherboard
</h2>
<h6>Align the notch on the RAM stick to the ridge in the slot, and firmly press the RAM into
    the slot until the side clips snap into place, securing the RAM. It's important to apply even pressure across the
    top of the module to avoid damaging the sticks or the motherboard.</h6>
<h2>
    SSD into the Motherboard
</h2>
<h6>Find the M.2 slot on your motherboard. This is typically located near the CPU but may be different depending on your
    motherboard's layout. If you're installing an NVMe SSD, ensure the slot supports PCIe and NVMe; if you’re installing
    a SATA M.2, you’ll need to make sure the motherboard supports M.2 SATA. Align the notches on the SSD with the M.2
    slot (it only fits one way). Insert the SSD at a slight angle and gently press the SSD into the slot until it clicks
    into place. Use a small screw (provided with the motherboard or the SSD) to secure the other end of the SSD to the
    motherboard. Most M.2 slots have a small standoff screw that holds the SSD in place. Tighten the screw carefully,
    but don’t overtighten it. </h6>
<h2>
    Thermal paste application for CPU
</h2>
<h6>Squeeze a small, pea-sized amount (about the size of a small grain of rice or a small dot) of thermal paste directly
    in the center of the CPU. You don’t need a lot; about 0.1 to 0.3 grams. More paste doesn’t necessarily mean better thermal performance.</h6>
<h2>
    Stock CPU cooler install OR AIO install
</h2>
<h6>
    Most stock coolers have a pre-attached bracket or one that needs to be installed. Align the cooler with the mounting holes on the CPU socket.
    Gently place the cooler on the CPU, ensuring the thermal paste spreads evenly. Don’t twist or slide it once in place.
    If your cooler has a backplate, make sure it aligns with the motherboard’s holes.
    Use screws or mounting clips to secure the cooler to the CPU socket. Tighten the screws evenly in a cross pattern (don’t overtighten).
    Plug the cooler’s fan connector (4-pin or 3-pin) into the CPU_FAN header on the motherboard.
    Ensure the cooler is seated firmly and the fan is connected properly.

    The AIO Cooler may be more expensive, but it might be worth it. Mount the backplate on the back of the motherboard using screws or standoffs. Align the pump/block unit with the
    CPU socket and screw it in place, tightening evenly in a cross pattern. Choose a location for the radiator and mount
    it using the provided screws. Attach the fans to the radiator. Connect the pump’s power cable to the CPU fan or
    dedicated pump header on the motherboard. Connect the fan cables to motherboard headers. Use a splitter if necessary
    for multiple fans. After installation, monitor your CPU temperatures to ensure proper cooling.
    </h6>
<h2>
    Motherboard installation
</h2>
<h6>To start installing the motherboard, first insert the I/O shield (the metal plate that covers the rear ports) into
    the back of the case. It fits into the top rear part and clicks into place, aligning with the ports on the motherboard.
    Next, install the standoffs—small screws that lift the motherboard off the case to prevent shorting. Place them in
    the holes in the case that match the motherboard’s screw holes, using the provided screws. Once the standoffs are in
    place, align the motherboard with the I/O shield and standoffs. Then, secure the motherboard by screwing it into the standoffs. Tighten the screws in a diagonal pattern, but don’t overtighten—just enough to hold it firmly.
    Finally, connect the 24-pin ATX power cable from the power supply to the motherboard’s 24-pin socket, and connect
    the 8-pin (or 4-pin) CPU power cable to the CPU power connector near the top-left of the motherboard.

</h6>
<h2>
    Fan configuration then installation

</h2>
<h6>For fans, there's two things you'll want to remember. Intake fans pull cool air into the case (front or bottom of the case).
    Exhaust fans push hot air out of the case (top or rear of the case) When installing
fans, it's important to set up your fans the right way.</h6>
<h2>
    PSU installation
</h2>
<h6>To install the PSU, position it in the case, aligning the PSU’s screw holes with the case’s mounting holes.
    Making sure to ensure the PSU fan faces either up or down based on your case design. Secure the PSU with screws. Then, connect
    the 24-pin ATX power cable to the motherboard’s 24-pin socket and the 8-pin CPU power cable to the CPU power
    connector. If your GPU needs extra power, connect the appropriate power cables, and connect SATA power cables to
    your storage drives. Tidy up cables using ties to maintain airflow, double-check all connections, and then plug in
    the PSU, switch it on, and power up your system.</h6>
<h2>
    SSD installation
</h2>
<h6>To install an SSD, first, choose the right slot. For a 2.5" SATA SSD, mount it in a bracket or cage, then slide it
    into a 2.5" drive bay and connect the SATA data and power cables. For an M.2 SSD, insert it into the M.2 slot on the
    motherboard, secure it with a screw, and no cables are needed. Double-check everything is connected properly, and
    your SSD is installed.</h6>
<h2>
    HDD installation (optional)
</h2>
<h6>To install an HDD, first, mount the drive in a 3.5" drive bay using screws or a mounting bracket. Slide the HDD
    into the bay and secure it with screws. Then, connect a SATA data cable from the HDD to the motherboard and plug in
    the SATA power cable from the PSU. Double-check that everything is connected securely, and the HDD is properly
    mounted before powering on your system.</h6>
<h2>
    Check Cables + Cable Management
</h2>
<h6>
    After installing your components, check that all cables are securely connected, including the 24-pin ATX, 8-pin CPU
    power, SATA data cables, and fan connections. Ensure front panel connectors (power button, USB, etc.) are plugged in
    correctly. For cable management, bundle similar cables together with ties, route cables behind the motherboard tray
    if possible, and avoid blocking airflow. Keep power cables neat and out of the way. Finally, double-check that all
    cables are properly connected.</h6>
<h2>
    GPU installation
</h2>
<h6>To install a GPU, first, locate the PCIe x16 slot on the motherboard (usually the topmost slot). Remove the metal
    bracket from the case’s rear panel that aligns with the slot. Gently insert the GPU into the PCIe x16 slot, making
    sure it clicks into place. Secure the GPU to the case with screws. If your GPU requires extra power, plug the 6-pin
    or 8-pin PCIe power cables from the PSU into the GPU. Finally, ensure the GPU is seated correctly and securely before
    closing the case and powering on your system.</h6>

<h2>
    Check PC
</h2>
<h6>Before actually powering on your PC, visually inspect that all components (motherboard, CPU, GPU, RAM, storage) are securely
    installed and connected. Ensure SATA power cables are connected to your drives and that cooling fans are properly
    installed without any cables obstructing airflow. Check that monitor, keyboard, and mouse are connected, and ensure
    the PSU switch is on. Finally, make sure no loose parts or wires are causing issues, and everything is seated properly.</h6>
<h2>
    Prep for Windows OS install + Installation
</h2>
<h6>To prepare for a Windows installation, create a bootable USB with the Windows installation tool, then insert it into
    your PC. Enter BIOS and set the USB as the primary boot device. Restart the PC and boot from the USB drive. In the
    Windows setup, select your language, accept the license terms, and choose Custom installation. Select the drive for
    installation (usually your SSD or HDD) and format it if needed. Windows will install, rebooting several times. After
    installation, complete the setup by creating a user account, connecting to Wi-Fi, and installing necessary drivers.
